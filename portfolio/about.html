   <p> In spring 2022 I took a data structures and abstraction course; in this course we were assigned a group project written in C++. My group <br> chose to make a program that was a <a href="https://github.com/nathyntran/CSC-212_Final_Project"> plagirism checker</a>. 
      In this project we used two hash string search algorithms, Robin-Karp and <br>Boyer-Moore. In our project we also compared the time efficency of both algithms.</p>
